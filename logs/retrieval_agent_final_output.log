Well, let me tell you, it's not just about manga. They offer a variety of engaging options. You can read manga, of course, but you can also play video games, use computers, and even take part in Purikura sessions. Purikura booths are quite popular; they enhance photos by smoothing skin, enlarging eyes, and adding fun effects. A typical Purikura session costs around 400-600 yen. These booths are common in malls, arcades, and entertainment areas across Japan. It's quite an experience, I must say!\\\"}\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n}"}
